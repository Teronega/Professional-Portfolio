## Description
Objective was to create a fully functional HTML & CSS site of a personal portfolio from scratch. When deployed, the site will resemble almost a resume, depicting my personal information and background for an "employer". This site will also use images relevant to the information within the boxes or topic. The navigation links will direct the viewer straight to the topic on the site.
